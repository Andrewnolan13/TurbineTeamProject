# TurbineTeamProject

Goal: Predict (power output/something else?) for wind turbines using weather forcast. Can be used to schedule maintenance. 

How: Get [historical weather data](https://open-meteo.com/). Get Wind turbine data (perferably for Ireland, perferably for more than one location). Train a model.

Deploy: make nice frontend with Dash. Use weather forecast api's for realtime updates. 

Problems: What does the weather data need to have? what does the wind turbine data need to have? Not sure because don't have wind turbine data yet.  



Goal: Dashboard and realtime prediction for different locations:

On-shore : 
Off-shore :
